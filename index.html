        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I am Ritika Magesh. I'm 11 years old and loves mostly to spend my time out-doors.I'm good at studies and is very fond of reading books. I also like to code in WhiteHat jr. I have so many hobbies too:Cycling,baking,swimming and watching movies. About my family; My parents, my sister and my grandparents. I have so many neighbours too. They are very loving and sweet. everyoneis kind-hearted. I also have lot of friends in my apartment. We have fun playing together.<br>
            Just because I love activities and sports, it doesn't mean I always play. I like to study too. I have fun reading and writing stories, painting and doing craft with waste or reusable materials, which are eco-friendy and handy.I like all sorts of things. I love to listen and dance to the music,where my feet can't wait to tap the floor.<br>
            Although, I love these many things, who wouldn't say no to television or movies,. Its my Favourite part too. i love to watch movies at night with some yummy snacks and drinks. I also love to go shoppping, but I hardly go anywhere.I've written a story called "the magic lamp", which has been published in a website called Bookosmia.I have won so many ,Medals and trophies at school and other competitions.
            Frankly saying, I love furry, cute animals and green plants. I have a friend visiting my house everyday. It is a squirrel. We feed him with food and water, where he and his small friends come for lunch. And one of his friend is a Foodie, where he comes all the time.

        <p>My favourite hobby is to cook dishes, cycling with my friends and playing badminton. In here I am going to share a few tips and videos on baking for beginners. This will help you to improve your skills and learn more about the environment. I have learnt a few baking ideas that helped me to improve myself. The first time I baked, it turned out really well but was a bit too soft, though it tasted nice.On the second time, it messed up. The cake cracked and it was burned, before it came out. Then later, we setteled it down and made a beautiful cup-cake with the help of my teacher, next door. Then combining her tips with the friend of my mothe"r's tip, it turned out very well. This made me think that"PRACTICE makes PERFECT"</p>

        <h1>My work</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My work is simpler like a normal kid. I study and then learn new things so that my brain gets stronger and smarter. Then, my work is to improve my out-door and in-door skills, so I train myself by playing chess, carom and improve my hobbies- side by side. Later in the evening when the sun is low, My friends and I go cycling or playing something. At times after that, I have got school work.<br>As much as I love learning and studying, I also like to test what I have learnt, so I also like my homework. Next, I watch youtube or play games on my laptop or my mom's phone. If I touch the phone, then a small rift would begin between me and my sister, so I stay away form her phone at all times. But if my sister is sleeping,I would surely snoop around and ask permission to watch. In a kid's life with a younger or elder sibling this would be the most common thing to hear.</p>

        <p>My inspiration is Enid Blyton. It's not because she is my favourite author, but I am inspired by her life-style, and her realistic books she has written.</p>
